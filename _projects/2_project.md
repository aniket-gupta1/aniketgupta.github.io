NeuROAM is an effort initiated by the Institute for Experiential Robotics at Northeastern University to create a large-scale, multi-robot dataset for advancing the state-of-the-art in mapping and SLAM systems. With the collaborative efforts of multiple labs, PIs, postdocs, phd students, graduate and undergraduate students, we are collecting a diverse dataset using a fleet of 5 diverse robots - Unitree Go2, Unitree GO2W, Boston Dynamics Spot, Agile-X Hunter and Agile-X Scout.

Each robot is equipped with the same sensor payload which includes a lidar, RGB Stereo Camera, IMU, GPS and Mesh Radios. The dataset consists of synchronized data all robots operating in indoor and outdoor environments.

### Key Features
* **Multi-Robot Coordination:** The dataset captures the dynamics of multiple robots working together in a shared environment, providing insights into coordination and communication strategies.
* **Diverse Environments:** Data is collected in a variety of settings, including indoor office spaces, outdoor terrains, and mixed environments, ensuring robustness and versatility.
* **Rich Sensor Suite:** Each robot is equipped with a comprehensive set of sensors, including LiDAR, RGB cameras, IMUs, and GPS, enabling multi-modal data analysis.
* **High-Quality Annotations:** The dataset includes detailed annotations for key features, obstacles, and landmarks, facilitating advanced research in perception and mapping.
* **Open Access:** The NeuROAM dataset is made publicly available to the research community, encouraging collaboration and innovation in the field of robotics.

### Applications
The NeuROAM dataset is designed to support a wide range of research areas, including:
* **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM):** Developing and testing SLAM algorithms in multi-robot scenarios.
* **Multi-Agent Systems:** Exploring strategies for coordination, communication, and task allocation among multiple robots.
* **Perception and Sensor Fusion:** Enhancing perception capabilities through the integration of data from diverse sensors.
* **Autonomous Navigation:** Improving navigation algorithms for robots operating in complex environments.
* **Robotics Research and Development:** Providing a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on cutting-edge robotics technologies.
